## Reddit User Persona:  The Aspiring Tech-Savvy Urbanite

Based on the provided Reddit posts and comments, we can construct a detailed user persona:

**Name:**  (Not provided, let's call him Alex)

**Age:** 30-35 years old

* **Supporting Evidence:** The post about feeling "violated" by intern season ([https://www.reddit.com/r/newyorkcity/comments/1lykkqf/i_feel_violated_by_intern_season/](https://www.reddit.com/r/newyorkcity/comments/1lykkqf/i_feel_violated_by_intern_season/)) suggests a level of maturity and established life in NYC, contrasting the youthful energy of interns.  His reference to generational trends in NYC further suggests he's been observing the city's dynamics for a while.  The mention of "boomers and millennials" in a Gen Z post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1erotgn/whats_a_movie_that_best_represents_your_childhood/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1erotgn/whats_a_movie_that_best_represents_your_childhood/))  places him outside of those generations, likely a Gen X or older millennial.  His financial discussions (options trading,  $4k Vision Pro purchase) imply a level of professional stability consistent with this age range.
